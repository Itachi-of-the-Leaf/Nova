  "authors": "Peter Dixon, Sutanu Gayen, A. Pavan, and N. V. Vinodchandran",
  "abstract": "We investigate the complexity of problems that admit perfect zero-knowledge interactive protocols and establish new unconditional upper bounds and oracle separation results. We establish our results by investigating certain distribution testing problems: computational problems over high-dimensional distributions represented by succinct Boolean circuits. A relatively less-investigated com- plexity class SBP emerged as significant in this study. The main results we establish are:\n\nA unconditional inclusion that NIPZK \u2286 CoSBP.\n\nConstruction of a relativized world in which there is a distribution testing problem that lies in NIPZK but not in SBP, thus giving a relativized separation of NIPZK (and hence PZK) from SBP.\n\nConstruction of a relativized world in which there is a distribution testing problem that lies in PZK but not in CoSBP, thus giving a relativized separation of PZK from CoSBP.\n\nResults (1) and (3) imply an oracle separating PZK from NIPZK. Our results refine the landscape of perfect zero-knowledge classes in relation to traditional complexity classes.",
